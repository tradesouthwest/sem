# SEM Semantic Element Model
markup ideology which uses the HTML5 Semantic Elements

## Overview
* SEM is a trial markup ideology which takes advantage of the Semantic Elements 
* Uses Semantic Elements as CSS Selectors to create a fully supported Browser document.

## Motivation
I do not intend on rebuilding the wheel by making the Semantics Elements a stand-alone 'framework' for HTML5, this experiment is only to allow minimal amount of styling so as to not throw off any DOM relationships the Semantic Elements have with any supported Browser. The only real intention is to relieve the programmer from the use of the &lt;div&gt; tag and apply style attributes directly to the Semantic elements. The experiment is validated using W3C Validator and passes 100 precent.
